#Virtual keyword uses (Polymophism)

This example shows how virtual keyword can be used to create virtual fuctions that work at poliphic way at runtime.

Functions with virtual gain polimorphism, that means subclasses implementation is ever called.
Functions without virtual, are just class called, that means that the function member called is the function of the class of this instace definition, any cast can modify the called member function.
Using raw pointers if your base class had some virtual member function a virtual destructor should be defined.
